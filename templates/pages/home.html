                <p>Correct daily brushing and toothpaste is the most important way to maintain oral and dental
                    hygiene and prevent cavities and the resulting diseases. Toothbrush care is also an important
                    component
                    of a clean and healthy mouth. Dental health is a major element in preserving human health,
                    as well as preventing it, and <u style="color: rgb(233, 26, 26);"> Teeth Lap</u> play an important
                    role in that.</p>

                <p> <u style="color: #f89e55;">The importance of brushing teeth:</u><br>
                    • Preventing the accumulation of plaque on the teeth (which is a sticky and thin layer formed on the
                    surface of the teeth from food residues and contains bacteria that cause gum disease and tooth
                    decay).<br>
                    • Prevention of gingivitis.<br>
                    • Save time and money spent on treating dental problems.<br>
                    • Get fresh breath, by preventing the formation of bacteria that cause bad odors.<br>
                    • Reducing the formation of external pigmentation on the surfaces of the teeth.<br>

                    • Place the brush on the teeth at an angle of 45 degrees, so that the bristles of the brush touch
                    the tip of the gums and teeth.<br>
                    • Gently brush every 2 or 3 teeth together, back and forth from the gum side to the end of the
                    tooth, and so on for the rest of the teeth.<br>
                    • Brush the back teeth (molars) by placing the brush at an angle of 45 degrees, back and forth, and
                    in a circular motion on all internal surfaces.<br>
                    • Clean the inside of the teeth using the brush head, and move the brush longitudinally up and
                    down.<br>
                    • Brushing the edges of the teeth, then brushing the tongue using its own brush, or with a
                    toothbrush.</p>
